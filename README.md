## How can you contribute?
This section discusses how to contribute to the learning content of this project, whether that is adding new content which addresses a new topic, or updating existing content that is already on the website.

### How can you contribute a new tutorial?
This section descibes how to add a new tutorial to the website.

1. Create a sub-folder within the `html` folder.
2. Name this sub-folder using the format `html_topic`.
    - For example, the **HTML Introduction** topic folder is named `html_intro`.
3. Create an `index.html` file inside of the sub-folder you just created.
4. Open the `copy.html` file in the repository's main directory.
5. Copy the HTML contents of the `copy.html` file into your newly-created `html_topic/index.html` file.
    - `copy.html` contains the basic structure that topic webpages follow in this project. It includes the HTML code for the metadata, header, footer and navigation buttons.
    - Edit the `<main>` element to add your tutorial content to the webpage.
    - Note that there are two `<div class="navigation-link">` elements within `<main>`. These two `<div>` elements contain the navigation buttons.
6. After creating the 'index.html' page of yours,add the links of previous file and next file to your html page inside `<div class="navigation-link">`.
7. 
   **Adding a video to the topic page**  
If you would like to add a video to the topic's webpage, see the code below:

```html
<div class="video__plyr">
    <video id="player" playsinline controls crossorigin data-poster="/path/to/poster.jpg">
    <source src="./cdn/video/Codes - 360.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="360" />
    <source src="./cdn/video/Codes - 540.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="576" />
    <source src="./cdn/video/Codes - 720.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="720" />
    <source src="./cdn/video/codes - 1080.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="1080" />
    </video>
</div>
```

To embed a video on the page:
- Add a `<div>` to the `index.html` file for your topic. Ensure that the `<div>`'s structure is similar to the one above.
- Inside the `<div>`, add one `<source>` element for each resolution/quality you will have for the video.
    - In the example above, the video is available in four resolutions so there are four `<source>` elements.
- Set the `src` attribute of the `<source>` element to a string containing the filepath/URL to the video.
    - In the example above, the video files are located in `./cdn/video/`, where `cdn` exists in the same directory as the topic's `index.html` file.

For more information on the HTML structure of topic webpages, please look into the `copy.html` file.
